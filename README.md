# IIS Installer

### Quick Start

1. Create a .json config file (or use an existing one)
2. Update the .exe.config to make sure the correct .json file is being used.
3. Run the .exe (as Administrator)

### TODO

- Recursive app/virtual directory creation (currently is hard-coded to maximum 2 levels of child entities)
- Implement delete existing application pools flag
